# Blocked Task Report: ComplexityStore Documentation

**Task ID:** task-del-complexitystore-documentation-  
**Date:** 2025-02-15  
**Status:** BLOCKED - Cannot Complete

## Reason for Block

The task requires documenting "HOW to use existing ComplexityStore", but **no ComplexityStore implementation exists** in the codebase.

### Search Results

Comprehensive search performed across:
- `/state-machine/` directory - does not exist
- `/core/` directory - no ComplexityStore
- `/contexts/` directory - no ComplexityStore
- `/hooks/` directory - no ComplexityStore
- `/bounded-contexts/` - no references to ComplexityStore
- `/utils/` - no ComplexityStore
- Recursive search for `*complexity*` files - no matches
- Recursive search for `ComplexityStore` in all `.js` files - no matches
- Recursive search for `class.*Store` patterns - no ComplexityStore found
- Search in `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` - no ComplexityStore documentation

### Attempted Solutions

1. ✅ Searched all directories recursively for ComplexityStore files
2. ✅ Searched all JavaScript files for ComplexityStore class definitions
3. ✅ Searched all JavaScript files for ComplexityStore usage patterns
4. ✅ Searched documentation files for ComplexityStore references
5. ✅ Checked recent commits for ComplexityStore implementation
6. ✅ Searched blocked reports for related tasks

## Recommended Enabling Work

Before this documentation task can be completed, one of the following must occur:

### Option 1: Create ComplexityStore Implementation (Recommended)
Create a new task to implement ComplexityStore with the following requirements:
- Define what "complexity" means in the Harmony Design System context
- Implement ComplexityStore as a state management pattern
- Determine if it's for:
  - Audio graph complexity tracking?
  - Component rendering complexity?
  - Performance complexity metrics?
  - User experience complexity levels?
- Follow existing patterns (e.g., EventBus, TypeNavigator)
- Include proper JSDoc documentation
- Create unit tests

**Suggested Task ID:** `task-create-complexitystore-implementation`

### Option 2: Clarify Task Requirements
If ComplexityStore exists under a different name or location:
- Provide the actual file path
- Clarify the correct class/module name
- Update task description with accurate references

### Option 3: Mark Task as Invalid
If ComplexityStore is not needed:
- Archive this task
- Remove from task queue
- Update any dependent tasks

## Dependencies

This task is blocked until:
- [ ] ComplexityStore implementation exists in codebase
- [ ] File path to ComplexityStore is provided
- [ ] Task requirements are clarified

## Next Steps

**Awaiting decision from task coordinator:**
1. Should ComplexityStore be implemented first?
2. Does ComplexityStore exist under a different name?
3. Should this documentation task be cancelled?

## Context

**Vision Alignment:** Not yet linked (mission_ref: del-complexitystore-documentation-)  
**Related Systems:** Possibly related to Reactive Component System or Performance monitoring

**Recent Commits Review:** No commits mention ComplexityStore implementation
