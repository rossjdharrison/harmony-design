# Blocked Task Report: undefined

**Date**: 2024
**Reporter**: Autonomous Executor
**Status**: Blocked - Cannot Start

## Reason for Block

The task cannot be completed because:

1. **Task ID**: `undefined` - No valid task identifier provided
2. **Task Description**: "Details not available" - No requirements or specifications provided
3. **No Context**: Cannot determine what needs to be implemented, modified, or fixed

## Attempted Solutions

1. Reviewed recent commit history - all commits show `feat(undefined): Task implementation`, providing no actionable information
2. Checked project context - marked as "No structure available"
3. Reviewed all global policies to determine if there's a default action - none applicable without task specification

## Impact

- Cannot create any files (unknown what to create)
- Cannot modify existing code (unknown what to modify)
- Cannot update documentation (unknown what to document)
- Cannot satisfy Policy #19 (Documentation Non-Optional) without knowing task scope

## Recommended Enabling Work

To unblock this task, one of the following is required:

1. **Provide Task Specification**: Include task ID, description, and acceptance criteria
2. **Provide Task Context**: Specify which component, feature, or system needs work
3. **Provide User Story**: Describe the problem to solve or feature to implement
4. **Provide Reference**: Link to design file, issue, or specification document

## Example of Sufficient Information

A valid task would include:
- **ID**: `HDS-123`
- **Description**: "Implement primary button component with hover and focus states"
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
  - Button component using Web Components
  - Shadow DOM implementation
  - Hover, focus, active, disabled states
  - Tested in Chrome
  - Documentation updated

## Next Steps

Awaiting task specification before implementation can proceed.
