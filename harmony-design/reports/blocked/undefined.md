# Blocked Task Report: undefined

**Date**: 2024
**Status**: BLOCKED - Cannot Proceed

## Reason for Block

The task cannot be completed due to missing essential information:

1. **Task ID**: Listed as "undefined"
2. **Task Description**: "Details not available"
3. **No specific requirements**: Cannot determine what needs to be implemented
4. **No acceptance criteria**: Cannot verify completion

## Attempted Solutions

1. Reviewed recent git commits (ff7e435, 1583b9b, c9682ce, 1684283, e8fdaf3) - all show generic "feat(undefined): Task implementation" messages
2. Examined project context - shows "No structure available"
3. Reviewed all global policies - none provide fallback for undefined tasks

## Impact

- Cannot create any files (unknown what to create)
- Cannot update DESIGN_SYSTEM.md (Policy #19 - no content to document)
- Cannot satisfy task-specific requirement #1 (implement task completely)
- Cannot verify Policy #10 compliance (no component to test in Chrome)

## Recommended Enabling Work

To unblock this task, one of the following is required:

### Option A: Provide Task Definition
- Supply valid task ID
- Provide task description with clear requirements
- Define acceptance criteria
- Specify deliverables

### Option B: Create New Task
- Generate a new task with proper definition
- Include specific implementation requirements
- Reference relevant design specs if applicable

### Option C: Clarify Intent
- If this is a test/diagnostic run, specify expected behavior
- If recent commits contain the actual work, clarify if task is already complete

## Next Steps

**Awaiting**: Task definition or further instructions

**Cannot Proceed With**:
- File creation
- Code implementation
- Documentation updates
- Git commits

**Compliance Note**: This report satisfies Policy #18 requirement to document blocked status rather than attempt invalid implementation.
