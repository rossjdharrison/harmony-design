# Blocked Task Report: undefined

**Date**: 2024
**Status**: BLOCKED - Cannot Proceed

## Reason for Blockage

This task cannot be implemented due to missing critical information:

1. **No Task Description**: The task description is listed as "Details not available"
2. **Undefined Task ID**: Task ID is literally "undefined" 
3. **No Project Context**: Project structure information is unavailable
4. **Ambiguous Commit History**: Recent commits only show generic "feat(undefined): Task implementation" messages without specific details

## Attempted Solutions

1. **Reviewed Available Context**: Checked task description, ID, and project structure - all unavailable
2. **Analyzed Recent Changes**: Examined commit history for clues - found only generic placeholder messages
3. **Consulted Global Policies**: Verified that policies require complete implementation but provide no fallback for undefined tasks

## Impact

- Cannot create any files (unknown what to implement)
- Cannot update documentation (unknown what feature to document)
- Cannot satisfy completion criteria (no defined criteria)
- Cannot verify against requirements (no requirements specified)

## Recommended Enabling Work

To unblock this task, one of the following is required:

### Option A: Provide Task Details
- Task ID (specific identifier)
- Task description (what needs to be implemented)
- Acceptance criteria (how to verify completion)
- Any relevant design specifications or requirements

### Option B: Provide Context from Recent Work
- Clarify what the recent "undefined" commits were implementing
- Provide project structure information
- Share any related task documentation or specifications

### Option C: Assign New Task
- Replace this undefined task with a specific, well-defined task
- Include all necessary context and requirements

## Next Steps

Awaiting:
1. Task definition and requirements, OR
2. Clarification of recent undefined commits, OR
3. New task assignment with proper specification

## Policy Compliance Note

This blocked task report satisfies **Policy #18: Blocked Task Reporting Protocol** which requires:
- ✅ Report created in harmony-design/reports/blocked/{task_id}.md
- ✅ Reason for blockage included
- ✅ Attempted solutions documented
- ✅ Recommended enabling work specified

The agent cannot proceed with implementation without violating policies that require complete, correct implementation of defined requirements.
