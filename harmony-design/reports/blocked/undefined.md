# Blocked Task Report: undefined

**Date**: 2024
**Status**: BLOCKED
**Reporter**: Autonomous Executor

## Reason for Block

Task cannot be completed due to missing critical information:
- Task ID: undefined
- Task Description: "Details not available"
- No specific requirements provided
- No acceptance criteria available

## Attempted Solutions

1. Reviewed project context - no structure information available
2. Checked recent git history:
   - f9504a6 feat(undefined): Task implementation
   - 4fae9ae feat(undefined): Task implementation
   - d4e364c Initial commit - Harmony Design System
3. Analyzed global policies - all understood and ready to apply
4. No actionable task specification found

## Required Information to Unblock

To proceed with task implementation, need:

1. **Task ID**: Unique identifier for tracking
2. **Task Description**: Clear description of what needs to be implemented
3. **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific requirements that define "done"
4. **Context**: Which part of the Harmony Design System this affects:
   - UI Component (primitive/molecule/organism/template)?
   - Bounded Context (Rust/WASM)?
   - Schema change?
   - Documentation update?
   - Infrastructure/tooling?

## Recommended Enabling Work

1. **Task Definition Task**: Create proper task specification with:
   - Clear objective
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Affected components/systems
   - Design references (if UI work)
   
2. **Task Management System**: Implement task tracking to prevent undefined tasks:
   - Task ID generation
   - Required fields validation
   - Task specification template

## Policy Compliance Notes

This report follows **Policy 18: Blocked Task Reporting Protocol**:
- ✅ Report created in harmony-design/reports/blocked/{task_id}.md
- ✅ Reason documented
- ✅ Attempted solutions listed
- ✅ Recommended enabling work provided
- ⏸️ Awaiting further instructions

## Next Steps

Awaiting task specification to proceed with implementation. Once provided, I am ready to:
- Apply all 21 global policies
- Implement following established patterns
- Update DESIGN_SYSTEM.md documentation
- Test in Chrome (if UI component)
- Commit and push changes

**Note**: System is operational and ready. Only missing: task definition.
