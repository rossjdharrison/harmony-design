# Blocked Task Report: undefined

**Date**: 2024
**Status**: BLOCKED - Cannot Proceed

## Reason for Blocking

This task cannot be completed due to missing critical information:

1. **Task ID**: Listed as "undefined"
2. **Task Description**: "Details not available"
3. **No specific requirements**: Cannot determine what needs to be implemented
4. **No acceptance criteria**: Cannot verify completion

## Attempted Solutions

1. ✗ Reviewed recent commit history - all commits show generic "feat(undefined): Task implementation" messages
2. ✗ Checked PROJECT CONTEXT - shows "No structure available"
3. ✗ Looked for task-specific requirements - none provided beyond general policies

## Impact

- Cannot create any files without knowing what to implement
- Cannot update DESIGN_SYSTEM.md meaningfully (Policy 19 requires documentation updates)
- Cannot satisfy "Implement the task completely" requirement
- Risk of introducing incorrect code or technical debt (Policy 4)

## Recommended Enabling Work

To unblock this task, one of the following is needed:

1. **Provide Task Details**: 
   - Clear task ID
   - Specific description of what needs to be implemented
   - Acceptance criteria

2. **Provide Context**:
   - Which component/module needs work?
   - What feature is being added/modified?
   - Are there design specs (.pen files) to reference?

3. **Alternative**: 
   - If this is a test/placeholder task, please provide a real task
   - If recent commits contain the actual work, clarify what additional work is needed

## Next Steps

Awaiting clarification on task requirements before proceeding.
