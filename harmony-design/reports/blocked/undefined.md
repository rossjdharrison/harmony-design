# Blocked Task Report: undefined

**Date:** 2024
**Status:** BLOCKED
**Reporter:** Autonomous Executor

## Reason for Block

This task cannot be completed due to missing critical information:

1. **No Task ID**: Task ID is listed as "undefined"
2. **No Description**: Task description shows "Details not available"
3. **No Project Context**: Project structure is not available
4. **Ambiguous Recent Changes**: Last 5 commits all reference "undefined" tasks with generic messages

## Attempted Solutions

1. ✗ Reviewed task metadata - insufficient information
2. ✗ Checked project context - no structure available
3. ✗ Examined recent commits - all show generic "feat(undefined)" messages
4. ✗ Cannot infer intent from policies alone

## Required Information to Unblock

To proceed with this task, I need:

1. **Clear Task ID**: A specific task identifier (e.g., "HDS-123")

3. **Acceptance Criteria**: How to verify the task is complete
4. **Project Structure**: Current state of harmony-design directory structure
5. **Related Files**: Any existing files that need modification
