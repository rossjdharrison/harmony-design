# Blocked Task Report: undefined

**Date**: 2024
**Reporter**: Autonomous Executor
**Status**: BLOCKED

## Reason for Block

This task cannot be completed due to missing critical information:

1. **Task ID**: Listed as "undefined"
2. **Task Description**: "Details not available"
3. **Project Context**: "No structure available"
4. **Requirements**: No specific implementation requirements provided

## Attempted Solutions

1. Reviewed recent commit history (5 commits visible, all with "undefined" task IDs)
2. Examined global policies for guidance on handling undefined tasks
3. Checked for implicit requirements in policy documentation

## Analysis

The recent commit history shows:
- `cbc8956 feat(undefined): Task implementation`
- `3d63e9e feat(undefined): Task implementation`
- `af75540 feat(undefined): Task implementation`
- `a690e4c feat(undefined): Task implementation`
- `4ec1c95 feat(undefined): Task implementation`

This pattern suggests a systemic issue with task tracking or metadata propagation rather than a single malformed task.

## Recommended Enabling Work

To unblock this task, one of the following is required:

### Option A: Provide Task Details
Supply the following information:
- Valid task ID
- Clear task description
- Specific deliverables expected
- Acceptance criteria
- Related design specifications (if applicable)

### Option B: Task System Repair
If this is a systemic issue:
1. Investigate task metadata pipeline
2. Repair task ID propagation mechanism
3. Resubmit task with proper metadata

### Option C: Default Task Assumption
If this is intentional (e.g., "implement next priority item"):
1. Provide access to task backlog/priority queue
2. Specify selection criteria for autonomous task selection
3. Confirm authorization for autonomous task prioritization

## Impact

**Cannot proceed** without one of the above enabling actions. Proceeding with undefined requirements would violate:
- Policy #3: Quality Gates Must Pass Before Proceeding
- Policy #4: No Technical Debt Introduction
- Policy #19: Documentation Non-Optional (cannot document undefined work)

## Next Steps

Awaiting:
- Task details from task management system, OR
- Instructions to select from available task backlog, OR
- Clarification that this report itself constitutes task completion
