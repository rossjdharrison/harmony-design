# Blocked Task Report: undefined

**Date:** 2024
**Status:** BLOCKED - Cannot Proceed
**Severity:** Critical

## Reason for Block

The task cannot be completed due to missing essential information:

1. **Task ID:** undefined
2. **Task Description:** "Details not available"
3. **No clear requirements or acceptance criteria**

## Context

The system shows recent commits with "feat(undefined): Task implementation" messages, suggesting previous attempts may have encountered similar issues or were placeholder commits.

## Attempted Solutions

1. ✗ Reviewed PROJECT CONTEXT - No structure available
2. ✗ Checked recent changes - All show undefined task implementations
3. ✗ Analyzed global policies - No default behavior specified for undefined tasks

## Impact

- Cannot implement features without requirements
- Cannot update documentation (Policy 19) without knowing what to document
- Cannot verify compliance with policies without task scope
- Risk of introducing technical debt if proceeding with assumptions

## Recommended Enabling Work

To unblock this task, one of the following is required:

### Option A: Task Definition (Preferred)
Provide a new task with:
- Clear task ID
- Specific description of what needs to be implemented
- Acceptance criteria
- Any relevant design specifications

### Option B: System Maintenance Task
If no specific feature work is needed, consider:
- Audit existing codebase for policy compliance
- Update DESIGN_SYSTEM.md with current system state
- Run quality gates on existing code
- Clean up placeholder commits

### Option C: Discovery Task
Create a discovery task to:
- Document current system architecture
- Identify gaps in implementation
- Prioritize next features based on design system needs

## Recommended Next Action

**AWAIT FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS** with properly defined task requirements.

## Notes

All global policies reviewed and understood. Ready to proceed once task requirements are provided.
