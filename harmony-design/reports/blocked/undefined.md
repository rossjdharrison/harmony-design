# Blocked Task Report

**Task ID:** undefined  
**Date:** 2024  
**Status:** BLOCKED - Cannot Proceed

## Reason for Blocking

The task cannot be implemented because:

1. **Task ID is undefined** - No valid task identifier provided
2. **Task Description is not available** - No implementation requirements specified
3. **No actionable requirements** - Cannot determine what files to create, what functionality to implement, or what problem to solve

## Attempted Solutions

1. ✗ Reviewed task context - found only "undefined" values
2. ✗ Checked recent commits - all show generic "feat(undefined): Task implementation" messages
3. ✗ Examined project context - marked as "No structure available"

## Context Information

### Recent Commits
All recent commits show the same pattern:
- 02df2f4 feat(undefined): Task implementation
- 31e8d24 feat(undefined): Task implementation
- 17b9983 feat(undefined): Task implementation
- 1c83828 feat(undefined): Task implementation
- cbc8956 feat(undefined): Task implementation

This suggests a systemic issue with task tracking or assignment.

## Recommended Enabling Work

To unblock this task, one of the following is required:

### Option 1: Provide Task Details
- Specify the task ID
- Provide task description with clear requirements
- Include acceptance criteria
- Identify which bounded context or component is affected

### Option 2: Create Enabling Task
If this is a new feature area, create an enabling task that:
- Defines the feature requirements
- Identifies affected components/systems
- Specifies implementation approach
- Lists deliverables

### Option 3: Review Task Assignment System
If task IDs are consistently "undefined":
- Investigate task tracking system
- Verify task assignment pipeline
- Check integration between task management and execution

## Impact Assessment

**Cannot proceed with:**
- File creation
- Code implementation
- Documentation updates
- Testing
- Git commits

**Policies that cannot be satisfied:**
- Policy #19 (Documentation Non-Optional) - No documentation can be written without knowing what to document
- Policy #1 (Task Implementation) - Cannot implement undefined requirements

## Next Steps

Awaiting one of:
1. Valid task ID and description
2. Instructions to create enabling task
3. Clarification on project status
