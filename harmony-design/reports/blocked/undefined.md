# Blocked Task Report: undefined

**Date:** 2024
**Reporter:** Autonomous Executor
**Status:** BLOCKED

## Reason for Block

The task cannot be completed due to missing essential information:

1. **Task ID:** undefined
2. **Task Description:** "Details not available"
3. **No specification** of what needs to be implemented
4. **No acceptance criteria** to validate completion

## Attempted Solutions

1. ✗ Reviewed recent commits (ef17e51, f378551, dc6528b, f9504a6, 4fae9ae) - all show generic "feat(undefined): Task implementation" messages with no context
2. ✗ Checked PROJECT CONTEXT - shows "No structure available"
3. ✗ Searched for implicit requirements in policies - none found that would indicate default behavior

## Policy Compliance Check

Cannot proceed while maintaining compliance with:
- **Policy 19 (Documentation Non-Optional):** Cannot document undefined work
- **Policy 3 (Quality Gates):** No criteria to validate against
- **Policy 4 (No Technical Debt):** Guessing at requirements would introduce debt

## Recommended Enabling Work

To unblock this task, one of the following is needed:

### Option A: Task Specification
Provide a task definition with:
- Clear task ID
- Description of what needs to be implemented
- Acceptance criteria
- Any relevant design specifications or context

### Option B: Context Recovery
If this is a continuation of previous work:
- Provide link to related task/issue
- Clarify what "feat(undefined)" commits were implementing
- Specify what remains to be done

### Option C: Default Action
If there's a standard "undefined task" protocol:
- Document the expected behavior
- Provide examples of previous undefined task resolutions

## Impact

- **Timeline:** Task cannot proceed until unblocked
- **Dependencies:** Unknown if other tasks depend on this
- **Risk:** None (no changes made)

## Next Steps

Awaiting:
1. Task specification from task management system
2. Clarification from project stakeholder
3. OR instruction to create enabling task for requirements gathering
