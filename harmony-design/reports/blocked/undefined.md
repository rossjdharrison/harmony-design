# Blocked Task Report: undefined

**Date**: 2024
**Status**: BLOCKED - Cannot Proceed

## Reason for Block

The task cannot be implemented due to missing critical information:

1. **Task ID**: "undefined" - No valid task identifier provided
2. **Task Description**: "Details not available" - No requirements or specifications
3. **Project Context**: "No structure available" - Missing architectural context

## Attempted Solutions

1. **Reviewed recent commits**: All recent changes show `feat(undefined): Task implementation`, providing no context
2. **Checked for task metadata**: No task-specific requirements found beyond global policies
3. **Analyzed project context**: No structure information available to determine scope

## Impact

Cannot proceed with implementation because:
- Unknown what component/feature to build
- Unknown which bounded context is affected
- Unknown acceptance criteria
- Cannot satisfy Policy #19 (Documentation Non-Optional) without knowing what to document
- Cannot create meaningful files without requirements

## Recommended Enabling Work

To unblock this task, please provide:

1. **Valid Task ID**: A specific task identifier (e.g., "HDS-123")
2. **Task Description**: Clear requirements including:
   - What component/feature to implement
   - Which part of the design system is affected
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Any design specifications (.pen files)
3. **Project Context**: 
   - Relevant bounded context(s)
   - Related components or dependencies
   - Integration points

## Next Steps

**Awaiting**: Task specification from task management system or human operator.

**Cannot Self-Proceed**: Per policies, autonomous execution requires valid task definition. This is a prerequisite blocker, not a technical blocker.
