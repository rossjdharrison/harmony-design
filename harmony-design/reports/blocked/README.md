# Blocked Task Reports

This directory contains reports for tasks that cannot be completed due to blockers.

## Purpose

Per **Policy 18: Blocked Task Reporting Protocol**, when a task cannot be completed, a report must be created documenting:

1. Reason for block
2. Attempted solutions
3. Recommended enabling work

## Report Format

Each report is named `{task_id}.md` and contains:

- **Date & Status**: When blocked and current state
- **Reason for Block**: Why task cannot proceed
- **Attempted Solutions**: What was tried
- **Required Information**: What's needed to unblock
- **Recommended Enabling Work**: Suggested next steps
- **Policy Compliance Notes**: How report follows protocols

## Resolution

When a task is unblocked:
1. Update report status to RESOLVED
2. Add resolution notes
3. Link to completing commit/PR
4. Keep report for historical reference
