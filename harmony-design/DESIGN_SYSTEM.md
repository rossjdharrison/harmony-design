# Harmony Design System

Welcome! This document describes the Harmony Design System - how it works, how to use it, and how to contribute.

## Task Execution

### Blocked Tasks

When a task cannot be completed, we follow a clear reporting process:

1. **Create Report**: Document the block in `harmony-design/reports/blocked/{task_id}.md`
2. **Include Details**: Reason, attempted solutions, recommended next steps
3. **Await Instructions**: Do not proceed until block is resolved

**Recent Blocked Tasks:**
- `undefined` - Missing task specification (see [reports/blocked/undefined.md](./reports/blocked/undefined.md))

### Task Requirements

Every task must have:
- Valid task ID
- Clear description
- Acceptance criteria
- Context (which system/component is affected)
- Design specifications (for UI work)

Without these elements, the task will be blocked per Policy 18.

## Contributing

(This section will grow as the design system develops)
