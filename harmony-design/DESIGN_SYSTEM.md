# Harmony Design System

## Blocked Tasks

When a task cannot be completed, we create a report to track the issue.

### Current Blocked Tasks

- **undefined**: Missing task metadata - see [blocked report](./reports/blocked/undefined.md)

### How Blocked Tasks Work

If you are assigned a task that cannot be completed:

1. Create a report in `reports/blocked/{task_id}.md`
2. Explain why the task is blocked
3. List what you tried to do
4. Suggest what needs to happen next
5. Wait for instructions

This helps us track problems and fix them quickly.

## Working with the System

(This section will grow as tasks are completed and features are added)
