feat(task-del-event-source-highlighting-show): Event source highlighting with color-coded badges and legend

Implements visual highlighting to show which component emitted each event in EventBusComponent:

- EventSourceHighlighter: Core class managing color assignment (12-color palette)
- SourceLegend: Interactive, collapsible legend showing all active sources
- Integration patch: Non-invasive extension of EventBusComponent
- Source badges: Color-coded labels on each event item
- Border highlighting: 3px colored left borders on event items
- Auto-detection: Extracts source from detail.source, componentId, or emitter
- Performance: <1ms badge creation, O(1) color lookup, GPU-accelerated animations
- Accessibility: Keyboard navigation, focus indicators, dark mode support
- Documentation: Updated DESIGN_SYSTEM.md with Event Source Highlighting section
