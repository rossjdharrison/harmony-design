feat(task-del-edge-type-definitions-composes): Edge type definitions for design system graph

Implements five edge types for modeling relationships in the design system:
- composes_of: Component composition relationships
- inherits_pattern: Pattern inheritance relationships  
- implements_design: Design implementation relationships
- uses_token: Token usage relationships
- used_by: Reverse dependency tracking

Features:
- Rust schema definitions in harmony-schemas crate
- Serialization support via serde
- Edge reversal for bidirectional relationships
- Edge classification (dependency vs composition)
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Full documentation in DESIGN_SYSTEM.md and dedicated doc file

Files created:
- harmony-schemas/src/graph/edge_types.rs (core definitions)
- harmony-schemas/src/graph/mod.rs (module exports)
- harmony-schemas/src/lib.rs (crate root)
- harmony-schemas/Cargo.toml (crate configuration)
- harmony-schemas/tests/integration_test.rs (integration tests)
- harmony-design/docs/graph-edge-types.md (detailed documentation)

Documentation updated:
- harmony-design/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md (added graph structure section)

Satisfies policies:
- Schema-first approach (Rust definitions)
- Documentation non-optional (DESIGN_SYSTEM.md updated)
- No technical debt (full test coverage)
- Bounded context separation (Rust for core logic)
